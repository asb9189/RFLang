- Allow return statements to have an empty expression (parsing issue)
    - idea: Only use return if you want to return a value, otherwise use a 'break'
    statement. Otherwise, parsing would get messy unless I wanted to add a semicolon.

- fix recursive functions (issue has to do with popping off from functionStack too soon)
