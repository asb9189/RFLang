- Allow return statements to have an empty expression (parsing issue)
    - idea: Only use return if you want to return a value, otherwise use a 'break'
    statement. Otherwise, parsing would get messy unless I wanted to add a semicolon.

- Add 'exit' statement to end the program instantly

- Remove the '-1' from  'return Value(-1. ValueType.NULL)' instances. It should never be an issue
    because the type is NULL, but it would be preferable to not pass around a hardcoded integer value

- fix recursive functions (issue has to do with popping off from functionStack too soon)

- clean up method calls on standard lib objects

- implemented chained method calls

- allow method calls directly after object construction
