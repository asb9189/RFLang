- Allow return statements to have an empty expression (parsing issue)
    - idea: Only use return if you want to return a value, otherwise use a 'break'
    statement. Otherwise, parsing would get messy unless I wanted to add a semicolon.

- Add 'exit' statement to end the program instantly

- move function calls and method calls into a single function
    inside the evaluator class

- iterator interface for objects
    - would allow support for a 'for each loop'

- fix recursive functions (issue has to do with popping off from functionStack too soon)

optional stuff:

- figure out how to deal with variable creation / reuse
    ex:

        let input = ""
        while True {

            input = input("...")

        }

    but it would be better if we could do

    while True {

        input = input("...")

    }

    // should input exist down here?

    ideas: maybe 'let' will map to constant global vars and "var" map to variables that can be redeclared
        and cease to exist after the current scope ends
