- write unit tests testing all features of RFLang using the new testing framework

- fix recursive functions (issue has to do with popping off from functionStack too soon)

- nested multiline comments don't work

    The following snippet will fail to parse ...

        @--

        print (
            List[1, 2].add(3).add(4).add(5).length()
        )
        @--
        --@

        --@

- add more functions to standard lib

- create README with documentation hosted on GitHub pages
