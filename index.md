#RFLang, a modern programming language that offers 

As a computer science student, I've always had an interest in programming language design. The majority of courses
in a computer science curriculum are about learning what's going on "under the hood". However, the one tool
we seem to avoid talking about is the most important one of all, programming languages themselves.

In fact, we use programming languages to explore the many domains of computer science ranging from low level systems programming in C
to abstract linear algebra in MATLAB all without having a clue how C or MATLAB work.

Fortunately, my institution taught a programming language concepts (PLC) course where we got to dive into the inner
workings of a programming language. More formally, how a language's syntax and semantics change the way in which
we write programs using it.

After completing PLC I decided (for better or for worse) to enroll in our graduate course known as 'compiler construction'.
Compiler construction is known as one of the hardest courses offered in most computer science curriculums along with
operating systems, and analysis of algorithms.

Ironically, the language I built 'RFLang' after being inspired by my compiler construction course is not a compiled one and is instead an interpreted language.
After getting my ass kicked during the code generation portion of our semester long project I decided I didn't want to go down
that path again and wanted to explore spinning up my own interpreter instead.
